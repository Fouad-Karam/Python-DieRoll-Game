# Python-DieRoll-Game
A simple game of rolling a single die and adding to the total everytime as long as you do not roll a 1.

Rules:
  1. Roll a single die, and as long as you don't roll 1, you keep adding the values you get.
  2. Feel lucky? keep rolling.
  3. The moment you roll a 1, you loose and the accumulated total will be shown.
  
 Enjoy!
